/* reload driver: migrates every array the old block's registry describes
   into a fresh block, with zero compiled-in layout knowledge. per entry:
   look up migrate_<name> in the migration dll, cross-check the entry's
   stride against the dll's migrate_<name>_old_size export, carve the new
   array with migrate_<name>_new_size, call the migration, and let the carve
   write the new registry entry. the host (or the new dll's on-reload entry)
   can drive this knowing only the block base pointers.

   a struct present in the old registry but absent from the migration dll
   was dropped from the new layout (diff only emits migrations for structs
   in the new header); its data is dropped with a note on stderr. */
